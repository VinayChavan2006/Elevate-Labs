## Personal Portfolio Landing Page

### 🌐 Vinay Chavan — Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome! This is my **personal portfolio website** built from scratch using **HTML and CSS**, with the goal of showcasing my background, interests, skills, and ways to get in touch. It also demonstrates my understanding of **responsive web design**, layout structuring, and modern UI practices.

🔧 What I Built
- Home Section: Quick introduction, name tag, short description, and contact button.

- Navigation Bar: Internal linking to sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

- Hero Section: Split layout with personal information on one side and a profile image on the other.

- Footer / Contact Section: Contact number, email, and social media links using Font Awesome icons
